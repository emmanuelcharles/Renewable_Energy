        <header>What is Renewable Energy ?</header>
        <br>
        <p>Renewable energy is an energy generated from natural resourses such as sunlight, rain, wind, tides and geothermal heat.
           The energy delivered from natural resources can be regenerated over time and never run out. The Renewable energies are 
           also called as zero-carbon energy as these energy does not emit CO2 while generating the power/Electricity.

        <header>Most Popular Renewable Energy Sources</header>
        <br>
        <p>As per in year 2023, currently there are 6 types of Renewable energy source</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wind Energy</p>
        <p>Hydro Energy</p>

                <p>Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using large wind turbines located on land (onshore) or in sea 
                    or fresh water (offshore). Onshore and Offshore wind energy technologies have evolved over the last few years to 
                    maximize the electricity. Many part of the world have strong wind speeds, but the best loaction for generating 
                    wind power are sometimes remote ones. Offshore wind power offers tremendous potential.

                <p>Hydropower energy is the largest source of renewable energy in the electricity sector. It
                    generates electricity from reservoirs and rivers. By building a dam or barrier, a large reservoir can be used to
                    create a controlled flow of water that will drive a turbine, generating electricity.This energy source is often
                    be more reliable than solar or wind power.

                <p>Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and can even supply power in cloudy weather.
                   Solar technologies can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, electricity and fuels for a host of applications.
                   Solar technology convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic panels or through mirrors.
                   The Solar panels have a lifespan of roughly 30 years. There variety of shades depending on the type of material
                   used in manufacturing.

                <p>Tidal or Ocean energy derives from technologies that use the kinetic and thermal energy of seawater waves to 
                    produce electricity or heat. Tidal energy system are still at an early stage of development with a number of
                    prototype wave and tidal current device being explored.Tidal energy is also an another form of hydro energy.

                <p>Bioenergy is produce from varieties of orangic materials called biomass such as wood, charcoal, dung and other

                    areas for cooking, lighting and space heating. In modern biomass system include dedicated crops or trees, residues 
                    from agriculture and forestry and various organic waste streams.

                <p>Geothermal energy is used to heat homes directly or to generate electricity by harnessing the natural heat below
                   the earth's surface. This heat is extracted from geothermal reservoirs using wells or other means. Once at the surface, 
                   fluids of various temperature can be used to generate electricity.The technology for electricity generation from hydrothermal
                   reservoirs is mature and reliable, and has been operating for more than 100 years.
